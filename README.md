Project Overview
Project: Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression on Continuous Dataset

Objective: Build a simple linear regression model to predict continuous target values, evaluating its accuracy through Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) metrics, and visualize results to assess model performance.

Key Activities
Data Preparation: Import, clean, and split data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train the linear regression model on the training set, evaluate it with MSE and R².
Evaluation and Visualization: Assess accuracy with MSE and R², plot regression line, and visualize actual vs. predicted values.
Technologies Used
Python: For data processing and model development
Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical operations
Matplotlib: Visualization of results
Scikit-Learn: Model building, data splitting, and performance metrics
Key Insights
Model Performance: MSE and R² metrics quantify prediction accuracy and model fit.
Feature Impact: Coefficient analysis shows each feature’s influence on the target variable.
Visualization: Regression line and scatter plots help validate predictions against actual values![op 2024-10-29 120309](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/528ef669-5834-45d2-8ca1-01246fa2522f)
